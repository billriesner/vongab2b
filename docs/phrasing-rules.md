# VONGA Phrasing Rules (Keep Language On-Brand)

## Primary CTA
- Use exactly **"Let's Connect"** everywhere except intake form submit button.
- Intake form submit button: **"Submit"**.
- Secondary CTA: **"See How It Works"**.
- Tertiary: "Meet Vonga", "Learn more →".

## Language We Use
- belong, memory, moment, story, journey, pride, identity, connection, community, gratitude, human, tangible, wearable, living.
- Phrases we "own":
  - "We make connection tangible."
  - "Issue membership, not merch."
  - "Merch that remembers."
  - "Your story, worn for life."
  - "Tech you can feel."

## Language We Avoid
- book a demo, request pricing, AI-powered, blockchain, web3, gamification, KPI soup (unless required in proof docs).
- Jargon overuse: engagement, funnel, activation (use **belonging**, **moments**, **stories** instead).
- **Em dashes (—)**: Always use periods or commas instead. Em dashes clutter copy and reduce readability.

## Style
- Short, cinematic sentences.  
- Readable aloud.  
- Emotion first, then clarity, then proof.

## Examples

**Good (email opener)**  
"Fans don't remember discounts. They remember the moment they felt seen. What if your next drop didn't end at checkout, it started there?"

**Good (deck headline)**  
"The world doesn't need more merch. It needs more meaning."

**Avoid**  
"Our AI-powered engagement platform leverages gamification to optimize LTV." → Rewrite:  
"We help people feel like they belong, and we give you a simple way to measure it."
