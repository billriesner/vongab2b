If anything changes, just reply to this email.

### 2. Touch #2 (T+30) - 30 Days

Has anything moved on your side?

A) we've got a season or event taking shape

Reply with A/B/C/D and I'll point you to the next simple step.

**Body:**

I'm holding short office hours next week. No slides. Just practical steps and questions.

If it helps, reply with one question you want answered. I'll send notes or we can hop on a quick call.

### 4. Touch #4 (T+180) - 180 Days

Hey {{ first_name }},

Checking in. Is "lasting fandom" still on your list this season?

If yes, I'll share a simple two-step plan for a small pilot. If not, I'll pause here and you can reach out when it's useful.
