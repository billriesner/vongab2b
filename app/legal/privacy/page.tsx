This includes your name, email address, shipping address, and billing information.

              When you tap a Vonga garment
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-md">
              Vonga's NFC technology is designed with privacy at its core. When you tap your phone to a Vonga garment, we do not access, collect, or store any personal content from your device. Your photos, contacts, messages, and other device data remain completely private.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-md">
              Instead, we only record the tap event itself, which is tied to the garment's unique digital twin identifier. This allows us to verify eligibility for rewards, content, or experiences associated with that specific garment. In some cases, we may also record time-based or location-based eligibility, such as confirming that a tap occurred during a specific event window or within a designated geofenced area. This information is used solely to determine whether you qualify for the associated benefit.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">
              Importantly, we do not log your precise device identifiers, track your location history beyond the specific eligibility check, or create profiles of your movements. Each tap is treated as an isolated event associated with the garment, not with tracking your personal behavior.

These metrics are presented in aggregate form and do not identify individual end users unless you've configured your platform to collect such information.

              Your Control at Tap
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-md">
              Every time you tap a Vonga garment, you remain in control of your data and privacy. When the tap experience loads, you have the choice to proceed with claiming the garment, signing up for rewards, or linking the tap to an existing account. You are never required to provide personal information simply to tap, and you can choose to interact anonymously if you prefer.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">
              If you decline to provide personal information or create an account, we record only an anonymous tap event for basic eligibility tracking. You can also revoke your consent for reward programs, data collection, or marketing communications at any time through your account settings or by contacting us directly. Your control over your data doesn't end when you first tap.

              Enterprise & Club Vonga Data Relationships
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-md">
              For organizations using our Club Vonga or Enterprise platforms, it's important to understand the data relationship. In these scenarios, your organization acts as the "data controller" (under GDPR terminology) or "business" (under CCPA terminology) for the personal information of your end users, members, or participants. This means your organization determines what data is collected and how it is used within the Vonga platform.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">
              Vonga acts as a "data processor" or "service provider" in this relationship, processing personal information only according to your organization's documented instructions and the terms of our agreement. We provide tools and assistance to help you respond to data subject rights requests from your end users and support your compliance with applicable privacy laws. If you have questions about your obligations as a controller or business, please consult with your legal counsel.
