          <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed" style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Vonga, LLC, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use of our products or Services. This includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed" style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
            In no event shall Vonga's total aggregate liability to you for any and all claims arising from or related to your use of our products or Services exceed the amount you actually paid to Vonga for the specific product or service giving rise to the claim. If you have not made any payments to Vonga, our total liability to you shall not exceed $100.

          <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed" style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

          <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed" style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
            Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of Vonga's products or Services, including disputes regarding the formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity of these Terms, shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except as otherwise provided below.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed" style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
            Arbitration will be conducted in Indiana, United States, and administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party will be responsible for its own arbitration costs, including attorney fees, except as otherwise required by applicable law or the AAA rules.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed" style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
            <strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> By agreeing to these Terms, you waive your right to participate in any class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration against Vonga. You also waive your right to a jury trial. All disputes must be brought in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed" style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
            Notwithstanding the arbitration provision above, either party may seek equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights or confidential information.
